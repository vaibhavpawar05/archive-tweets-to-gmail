# archive-tweets-to-gmail
This repo has the code to archive twitter threads especially the bookmarks to gmail. It saves a static html with all images to gmail so even if the tweets are deleted from Twitter, the saved threads in gmail will be unaffected. Since Gmail does not support videos in its html, only videos are included as a link.

## How to run
- Clone the repo
- Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install snscrape requests
```
- Get the bookmarks.json for your Twitter bookmarks and save it in the repo folder
  - <>
- Get the app password for the sender gmail account
  - <>
- Make the following changes to the `main.py` file
  - update the `sender_email` and `receiver_email`
  
Here are a couple of screenshots of how the threads look -
